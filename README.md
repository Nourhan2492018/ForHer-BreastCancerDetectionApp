# ForHer-BreastCancerDetectorApp-
For Her system is the door-way to an improved health care experience recently we find that there is a great pressure on doctors than ever before although they try to maintain levels of patient care and safety. this system will reduce the pressure and make things easier for patients as it will let patients find the best doctors and easily can communication with them.The main idea of our project is detection of breast cancer and increase awareness about it as we notice the great increase in the number of people who carry the disease and also the lack of awareness about it. the system will help the user to know if she carries the disease or not and her time and effort will be saved as it detects the disease faster as she won’t have to wait for an appointment with doctor to diagnose her x-ray results .patient can post the image to be diagnosed, system can detect if the upload image contain cancer or not, system nominate the doctor with higher rate to the patient, system increases the rate of each doctor based on the number of likes on his comment, doctors can comment and like other doctor’s comment, patient can chat with doctors she likes, short cancer self-examination video with notification to remember the time to test and the system will send notification to patients with cancer periodically to motivate them.
